"""Builds a :class:`ModelBinding` for a model id, and caches it.

One place answers "which credential serves this model", so a per-session
model, a subsystem pin and the configured default all resolve the same way
instead of each guessing. Caching matters because a session switching back
and forth must not rebuild a provider per turn -- building one imports
LiteLLM and writes vendor env vars.

Provider resolution has to go through a config copy with the model
substituted: :meth:`Config._match_provider` short-circuits on a forced
``agents.defaults.provider``, so asking the live config about another
vendor's model would answer with the forced one and pair the wrong key.
